//You may change this file

//You MUST leave this function prototype
//You MUST use a Queue to solve this problem
//n is the number of people
//m is denotes how often to kill a person
//If n=7 and m=3, you would have 7 people and start by killing
//the third person.
//Return an ARRAY contain the people in the order by died
//Example: n=7 and m=3
//Array Returned will be [2, 5, 1, 6, 4, 0, 3]

//You are free to add any additional functions you need

//Main Function
//Takes 2 command line arguments
int main(int argc, char** argv){
	//Check that we are given two
	//arguments
	//Also check that they are both > 0
	
	//Implement this function
	return 0;
}

//Solve the Josephus Problem
//Input: n - number of people
//       m which person to start killing on
//       Every m-th person is killed
//Outputs: Array with people killed in order of death
//Side Effects: None
//NOTE: YOU MUST SOLVE THIS USING YOUR QUEUE
int* josephus(int n, int m){
	//Implement this function
	return NULL;//Delete this line
